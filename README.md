# ProjectSet App

[ProjectSet App](https://projset.io) is an application that exposes an OpenAPI interface and UI, allowing users to create ProjectSet templates and ProjectSet instances. The application is integrated with identity providers like Active Directory (AD) and OAuth2 providers and encapsulates state generation logic and integration with external services such as OpenAI and ServiceNow. Users can interact with the app directly using the UI and/or Chat Bot that are integrated with the ProjectSet App using the API.
